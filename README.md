Mesimah Manager is an Android application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently.
Users can add tasks with a title, description, and date range (start date and end date). 
The app utilizes Room Database for data persistence, List Adapter with DiffUtil.ItemCallback for efficient list handling, 
ViewModel for lifecycle management, and two-way data binding for interactive UI components.
